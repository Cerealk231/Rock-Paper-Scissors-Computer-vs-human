# Rock, Paper, Scissors — Player vs Computer 🎮🪨📄✂️

This is a simple **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game written in Python, where a player competes against the computer. The computer makes a random choice, and the result is determined based on classic game rules.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The user is prompted to enter a choice: `rock`, `paper`, or `scissors`.
2. The computer randomly selects one of the three options.
3. The winner is determined based on the standard rules:
   - Rock beats Scissors
   - Scissors beats Paper
   - Paper beats Rock
4. The outcome (win/lose/draw) is displayed.
